# Task
Develop an OOP application that implements a search for the pair of closes vertices on an XY plane
that are separated by "y = x" graph.

# Implementation details
X & Y coordinates of vertices must be passed as command line arguments
in a form of pairs of integers. Coordinates of a found pair and the distance between found vertices must be displayed
in standard output stream. The application must include vertex class with private fields for coordinates
and public initialization constructor, getters, method for computating the distance between this and another point.
The application must also include a dynamic memory allocation for vertices and an array of its addresses.
