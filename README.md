# What is this repo?
This repo sores a collection of solutions for OOP course of BMSTU RK6 department.

# Solution details
Every solution is put into its separate folder in which its task is placed as a README file.
All solutions are tested on Arch Linux x86-64 system using GNU Compiler Collection (gcc 13.2.1).

## Personal recommendation
I highly advise **against** blind copypasting from this repo, as professors tend to ask about your code.
Although I aim to keep everything within normal limit complexity, somethimes the most optimal solution may invlolve
STL, templates and other things you weren't taught (yet?) so please make sure you understand the code before using it.

## How to help?
If you think you made a better solution you may propose it as a pull request and I'll make sure to include it
if it is indeed superior to the solution present in the repo. *Also, spread the word*
