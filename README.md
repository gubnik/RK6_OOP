# What is this repo?
This repo hosts a collection of solutions for OOP course of BMSTU RK6 department.

# What are the solutions?
I publish solutions for my variant, tasks itself are put into corresponding solutions' folders.
All solutions are made for C++11 using Standard Template Library but I try to keep templates to minimum.

## Why is this repo in English? Ty cho, pendos?
I update this repo from my Arch Linux laptop and I don't want to bother myself with adding another 
language. Also, you'll gonna need technical English anyway so think of it as of practice.
