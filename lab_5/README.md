# Task
Develop an OOP application for calculating distance from any line defined by 2 vertices and 0,0 point of XY plane.

# Implementation details
Implementation must include a vertex class with private fields for double X & Y coordinates and public getters and an
initialization constructor, as well as a line class with private field for 2 vertices and public getters, an initialization
constructor and a method for calculating the distance between the line and 0,0 point.
