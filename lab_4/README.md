# Task
Develop an OOP application for calculating reoccuring characters in a pair of strings.

# Implementation details
Implementation must include letter set class with private field of an array of two unsigned 32-bit integers corresponding
to encoded character bits and public getter and constructor. Operator overloads must include operator ',' for calculating
the amount of '1' bits in encodings of 2 sets, operator '&' to calculate reoccuring characters in 2 sets via masking.
Output must be made by overloading cast to char* operator.
